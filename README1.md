# How to Create and Populate
No special actions are required. The database will be created and populated prior to using the GUI. In order to populate the database, ensure the 4 CSV files (`awards.csv`,`colleges.csv`,`players.csv`, and `teams.csv`) are in the same folder as the `main.py` program

# How to Run
- First install(if not installed already) `pandas`, `numpy`, `tkinter`,`pandastable` and `pyodbc` using pip
- Ensure you are either on the University's network or are using the VPN
- The credentials for accessing the database have already been entered(one of our group members)
- Either run the program from an IDE(VS Code) or in the command prompt and in the directory of the project, type `python3 main.py`
